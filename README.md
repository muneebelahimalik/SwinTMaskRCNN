# Swin Transformer Augmented Mask RCNN
Enhancing instance segmentation using the Swin Transformer as a backbone in the Mask R-CNN architecture.

## Project Goal
The goal of this project is to replace the backbone of the Mask R-CNN instance segmentation model with the Swin Transformer architecture. By doing so, we aim to take advantage of the Swin Transformer's ability to capture both local and global context in images, potentially enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of instance segmentation tasks.

## Current Progress
Currently the project contains a Pytorch implementation of the Swin Transformer for feature extraction (as an independent entity for object detection).

## Future Plans

While the current implementation focuses only on the feature extraction abilities of the Swin Transformer architecture, soon we will integrate Mask RCNN Archiecture as the front end model for instance segmentation.

## Usage

Coming soon
